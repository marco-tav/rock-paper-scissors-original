# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a website in which you can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. Originally the website was designed so the game is played via prompts and, as I learned new stuff (DOM manipulation in particular), a UI version was added that allows the game to be played with buttons.
